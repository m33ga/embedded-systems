# Embedded Systems Laboratory Works

This repository contains modular embedded systems projects developed using PlatformIO and the Arduino framework. Each laboratory work demonstrates fundamental embedded concepts through hands-on implementation on microcontroller boards (Arduino Mega 2560, ESP8266). The codebase follows SOLID principles with strict separation between application logic, hardware services, and low-level drivers to ensure reusability across multiple projects.
